### An interactive performance

VIOLASTREAM is an online, interactive performance in order to explore the performer's body in relations to the others. Audiences have access to a hand-coded webpage with embedded livestream, action buttons, and a comment box. All inputs are connected via Socket.io to a p5.js sketch, which displays as an overlay of the livestream through Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). P5.speech was employed to conduct text-to-speech functionality, which reads out all inputs from the audiences.
